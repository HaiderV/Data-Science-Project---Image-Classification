# Data-Science-Project---Image-Classification
This project is a simple image-classification system built using machine learning. It takes an image as input, processes it, and predicts the class it belongs to. The goal is to provide a clear, beginner-friendly example of how image classification works end-to-end — from loading data to training a model to making predictions.
